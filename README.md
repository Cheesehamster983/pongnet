I realy dint know much to say but yeah this is my first github project 
and if you want to play 1 of the 2 pong games here is a link: https://cheesehamster983.github.io/pongnet/index.html (for pc/laptop)
The controlls for this are the up and down arrow.


If your intrestet in the second game of pong its recomended for devices like telefons and tablets.
https://cheesehamster983.github.io/pongnet/pong.html
Controlls are the up butten to let the square go op and the down button to let it go down.



(update of what i'm doing at the moment with this project)
