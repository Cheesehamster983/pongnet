Version of pongnet at the moment: 0

The realese coming soon: 1
I currently made (with ai ofc) a home menu on the server and i upgraded the touchscreen pong a bit (added a outerline to the playing field)

Now i just going to wait for the domein to comin and configure the server zo i can run this on the server!
(there is nothing wrong with the 1 from github so yeah the project was also a bit about a working webserver with something fun in it!)
